A server is a computer that provides information to other computers called "clients" on a computer network.[1] This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients or performing computations for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device.[2] Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.[3]
