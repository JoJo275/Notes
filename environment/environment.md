    **work on website once website development skills are improved**
- I wonder if there are services or applications for sketching/planning a website
* could make reddit, discord, forum for helping and discussing all things programming (as if there weren't tons already)
* helpful resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments 
* Think a bit more on the specifics
* Doesn't seem to be other websites with a view like the one stated here
