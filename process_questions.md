## üîç Before Writing Any Code ‚Äî Understanding the Problem

**This is where real programming begins.** Code is just the final step.

- Do I **fully understand** what the program needs to do ‚Äî *inputs, outputs, and constraints*?
- What problem am I **actually solving** ‚Äî and what would **success look like**?
- Have I defined **edge cases** (*empty inputs, large data, unexpected user behavior*)?
- Can I explain the problem clearly in **plain English** or **pseudocode** before touching the keyboard?
- Am I **reinventing the wheel**, or does a reliable library/framework already exist for this?
- What's the **simplest way** to achieve this result? (*Simplicity beats cleverness.*)
- What is the **input**, and what is the **exact expected output**?
- Can I describe the problem in **plain English** (or pseudocode) before coding it?
- Have I broken the problem into **smaller, manageable parts**?
- What's the **simplest possible version** I could build first (*MVP / prototype*)?
- Have I checked if a **built-in function** or library already solves this?

üí° ***"If you can't explain what the code should do in words, you can't write it correctly."***

## üß† While Designing the Solution

Think about **how** to structure your logic.

- What **data structures** make this problem easier (*lists, dicts, trees, etc.*)?
- What **algorithms** fit best, and what's their **time and space complexity**?
- How will this code **scale** with more data or users?
- Could I break this down into **small, reusable functions** or modules?
- What are the **assumptions** I'm making, and are they safe?
- If someone else reads this code, would they **understand the logic quickly**?

## üíª While Writing Code

Here you focus on **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **correctness**.

- Am I writing code that is **readable first**, *fast second*?
- Do my variable and function names **describe what they do** clearly?
- Is there any **repeated code** that could be refactored into a function?
- Am I using **meaningful comments** or letting the code be **self-explanatory**?
- Is this the **simplest working solution**, or am I *overengineering*?
- Will **future me** (or a teammate) understand this without context?
- What **errors might occur** ‚Äî and how will my program **handle them**?
- Am I **validating user input** and preventing crashes?
- Is this code **modular**, or is everything *tangled together*?
- If I change one part, will it **break something else**?
- Am I coding for **correctness first** or *cleverness first* (and why)?

üí° ***Readable beats clever*** ‚Äî especially when debugging your own work later.

## üß™ While Testing & Debugging

**Great programmers constantly test assumptions.**

- Does this code handle **edge cases** correctly (e.g., *0, null, empty lists*)?
- Have I written **unit tests** for critical logic?
- Am I testing both **valid and invalid** inputs?
- What happens if the environment or file system behaves **unexpectedly**?
- When I find a bug, do I **understand why** it happened, or just patch it?
- Can I **reproduce the issue** consistently before fixing it?
- Does the fix introduce **new side effects**?
- What **exactly is happening** versus what I **expected to happen**?
- Where's the **first place** the program's behavior diverges from my expectation?
- Have I tested the **smallest possible piece** of the program that fails?
- Can I **reproduce the bug** consistently?
- What are the **assumptions** I'm making ‚Äî and have I **verified them**?
- Have I **read the error message carefully** (and Googled only *after* understanding it)?
- Did I recently change something that could **affect this area**?

üí° ***Debugging is not fixing mistakes ‚Äî it's investigating assumptions.***

## ‚öôÔ∏è While Optimizing or Refactoring

Once it works, make it ***beautifully efficient.***

- Which parts of the code are **slowest** or most **memory-heavy**?
- Is this optimization **worth the added complexity**?
- Can I replace manual loops with **built-in methods** or libraries?
- Have I **profiled the program**, or am I *guessing* performance bottlenecks?
- Can I **simplify logic** without losing clarity?
- Does the new version **pass all previous tests**?
- Is my solution **efficient enough** for real-world input sizes?
- Are there **unnecessary computations** or nested loops I can simplify?
- Can this code handle **invalid or unexpected input** gracefully?
- Have I written at least **minimal tests** to verify it works over time?
- Is my code **secure** and free from obvious vulnerabilities?
- Have I cleaned up **temporary print statements** or debug code?
- Would this code still **make sense to me** in three months?

üí° ***"It works"*** *is step one* ‚Äî ***"It's solid"*** *is the real goal.*

## üîç Before Committing / Submitting ‚Äî Communication

These help ensure **professionalism** and **maintainability**.

- Have I left **helpful comments** explaining *why*, not *what*?
- Did I write a **clear commit message** describing the purpose of the change?
- Have I followed **consistent indentation** and style guidelines (*PEP 8, etc.*)?
- Would I be **proud to show** this code in an interview or portfolio?
- If someone else reads this, could they **use or modify it** confidently?

## ü§ù While Integrating or Collaborating

Programming isn't just solo ‚Äî think **team and environment**.

- Does my code **fit into the larger system** cleanly?
- Have I followed the team's **style guides** and **naming conventions**?
- Did I **document** new functions or APIs I created?
- Did I write **clear commit messages** describing *what changed and why*?
- Am I handling **dependencies and environments** safely (e.g., *virtualenv, package.json, requirements.txt*)?
- Could someone else **run my project easily** from a fresh setup?

## üîé When Reviewing or Reflecting

This is how you ***level up*** as a programmer.

- What did I **learn** from this project or bug?
- What did I **struggle with**, and why?
- Was my plan **efficient**, or did I waste time on the wrong parts?
- What part of this code would I **refactor** if I revisited it later?
- Did I **document my learnings** so future projects are smoother?
- What **new concepts or tools** could make this easier next time?
- What **habits or shortcuts** slowed me down?
- What **patterns** worked really well here?

üí° ***Every project is a lab experiment in making yourself a better engineer.***

## üßò Mindset & Habits

These keep you **sharp**, **patient**, and **evolving**.

- Am I **curious** about *why* something works, not just *that* it works?
- Do I **read other people's code** regularly to learn new styles?
- Am I **balancing** learning new tech with mastering fundamentals?
- Am I writing code I'm **proud of**, not just *"code that runs"*?
- Do I **stop to refactor** when I see messy code ‚Äî or keep piling on?

## üß≠ Bonus: Meta-Questions for Deep Thinking

For when you want to think like an **architect**, not just a coder:

- What **trade-offs** am I making between *simplicity and flexibility*?
- Am I solving the problem **today**, or trying to predict tomorrow's problems **too soon**?
- How would this design **scale** if *100√ó more data or users* existed?
- What **assumptions** about the environment or users does my code make?
- Could my approach be **generalized or reused** elsewhere?
